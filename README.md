# Kill the Spider

Augmented Reality Project made with Unity/Vuforia.

A simple re-imagination of the popular Whack-A-Mole game with spiders. 

The goal of the game is to kill as many spiders as possible in a fixed amount of time. The spiders randomly appear at fixed locations and disappear after a random short amount of time. The player can kill them by quickly tapping on their location.
